The Python file focuses on marketing analytics using a bank marketing dataset to analyze customer conversion behavior. It begins with data loading and exploration, followed by the creation of a binary “Conversion” variable to identify whether customers subscribed to a product. The analysis evaluates conversion rates across different education levels, highlighting segments with higher success rates. Categorical variables are encoded for modeling, and a Decision Tree classifier is built using features such as balance, duration, education, and default status. Feature importance analysis reveals key factors influencing conversion, providing actionable insights to improve targeted marketing strategies and optimize campaign performance.
